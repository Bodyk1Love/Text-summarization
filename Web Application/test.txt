Hundreds of millions of euros have been pledged to help rebuild Notre-Dame after a devastating fire partially destroyed the French cathedral.
The fire, declared fully extinguished some 15 hours after it began, ravaged the 850-year-old building's roof and caused its spire to collapse.
But firefighters who worked through the night managed to save the Paris landmark's main stone structure, including its two towers.
The cause of the fire is not yet clear.
Paris public prosecutor RÃ©my Heitz said his office was "favouring the theory of an accident", but had assigned 50 people to work on what he believed would be a "long" and "complex" investigation.
Other officials have suggested it could be linked to extensive renovation works taking place at the cathedral.
For centuries the building has been considered the heart of Catholic life in France, a site of pilgrimage for people around the world and home to many priceless religious relics.
French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to reconstruct the historic building even as the fire still burned, while two French business magnates had pledged about between them by early Tuesday.
Offers of help with the reconstruction have also poured in from around the 
globe, with European Council President Donald Tusk calling on EU member 
states to rally round.
