# Project info
This is an educational project for Ukrainian pupils and students to reduce time making a summary. 

## Text-summarization
What is Text-summarization? There is an enormous amount of textual material, and it is only growing every single day.Think of the internet, comprised of web pages, news articles, status updates, blogs and so much more. The data is unstructured and the best that we can do to navigate it is to use search and skim the results.There is a great need to reduce much of this text data to shorter, focused summaries that capture the salient details, both so we can navigate it more effectively as well as check whether the larger documents contain the information that we are looking for. We (humans) are generally good at this type of task as it involves first understanding the meaning of the source document and then distilling the meaning and capturing salient details in the new description. As such, the goal of automatically creating summaries of text is to have the resulting summaries as good as those written by humans. It is not enough to just generate words and phrases that capture the gist of the source document. The summary should be accurate and should read fluently as a new standalone document.

## Project name
The name of this product is "Press". Why “Press”? Because we see our logo like that: a paper sheet full of text in the center. Then a big press fall on this sheet and as a result you get a pressed piece of paper with only necessary information. So just press the button and our Press will do all “dirty” work.

## For whom?
All students and working people often need to summarize large amount of text fast. Actually they can do it easily in case if they summarize English text because there are quite a few such a products in open access. Our project is oriented on Ukrainian people’s needs since existing text summarizators sometimes skip important aspects of Ukrainian grammar, punctuation etc. As a result you get low-quality output.  Our program must be at least bilingual (Ukrainian and English) and we will work to add as many languages as our users require.
